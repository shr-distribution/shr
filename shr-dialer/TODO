phonekit-lib:
* sends dbus events to ogsmd
* the dialer application (the one used to place calls) is linked against it

phonekit-daemon:
* listens for incomming dbus events (like call recieved)

phonegui-lib:
* an incomming call dialog
* a pin code prompt
* other dialog raised by "incomming" dbus events
* obviously the phonekit daemon is linked against it

dialer:
* the dialer application you use to place calls
* can be launched to display the call history directly (when you clock on a
missed call notification for instance, not sure about this one though)
